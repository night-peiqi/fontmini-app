## About

The large size of the Chinese font pack is a problem that countless front-end developers are troubled by, as there are too many Chinese characters, and developers have made many optimization measures for it.

Font Mini completely solves this problem by extracting the text it uses from the font pack and generating a smaller new font pack.

## Usage

1. Upload your font pack.
2. Enter the text you need.
3. Click to generate.
